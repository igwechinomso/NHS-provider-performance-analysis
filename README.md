#### Key Insights and recomendations
###### Key Insights 
* ###### Service Type by Diagnosis:
  - Most migraine and hypertension patients were outpatients, while fractures and asthma required more inpatient or          
    emergency services.
* ###### Gender-Based Cost Analysis:
  - Male patients accounted for £2.5M, significantly higher than female patients (£1.8M).
* ##### Weekly Patterns:
  - Majority of patients (51.85%) were treated on weekdays, followed by 32.15% on weekends.
* ##### Quarterly Trends:
  - Billing and insurance coverage steadily declined from Q1 to Q4, suggesting either reduced
    patient load or lower service utilization later in the year.

###### Recomendations

  - Conduct feedback sessions and invest in patient experience improvement in Pediatrics.
* ##### Resource Planning:
  - Address seasonal trends by ensuring adequate staffing and service availability in Q1, when patient volumes are highest.
